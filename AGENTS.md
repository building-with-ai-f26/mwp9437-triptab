# AGENTS.md: Coding Agent Operating Manual

> Give this file to your coding agent and check that it is using these instructions. Keep the stack, commands, and ground rules current.

## 1. Project Overview
- **What this repo builds:** TripTab, a group-trip tool where confirming a plan logs who paid and who joined, and a settle-up view shows the fewest payments that square everyone.
- **Primary user & core workflow:** [See the living PRD in `docs/index.html`]
- **Tech stack:** React 19 + TypeScript + Vite in `app/`; data in browser localStorage (no server, no API keys in Build 1); Vitest for tests. Product Page is plain HTML in `docs/` (GitHub Pages). Money is stored in whole cents.

## 2. Commands
- **Install dependencies:** `cd app && npm install`
- **Run locally:** `cd app && npm run dev` (then open the localhost URL and click "Load sample trip")
- **Run deterministic tests:** `cd app && npm test`
- **Run model evals:** none yet (no AI model in the product as of Build 1)

## 3. Non-Negotiable Engineering Rules
1. **Plan before coding:** Before touching multiple files, propose a brief plan and wait for approval.
2. **Small batches:** Make small, focused changes that can be reviewed and explained by a human in a single Pull Request.
3. **Explainability:** Avoid unnecessary abstractions or dependencies. Help the human builder understand the main components, what changed, why it matters, what could break, and how it was checked.
4. **Verify changes:** Run relevant checks. For a reproducible logic bug, use a failing test to demonstrate the fix when practical. Record manual checks and known limitations; follow the selected Build 4 evaluation track.
5. **Zero secrets in code:** Never hardcode API keys, tokens, or credentials. Always read from environment variables (`.env`) and update `.env.example` when new variables are needed.
6. **Stop when looping:** If a fix fails twice in a row, stop, summarize what failed, and ask the human before trying a third approach.
